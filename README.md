# Hello! My Name is Colin Herbert

I am a recent graduate from the University of Arizona with a degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering with a minor in Computer Science. I have about 1 year of work and internship experience on a software team, and have a diverse background with multiple programming languages.

## Projects on this Site
- Senior Capstone Project - Launch Vehicle Ground-Support Equipment sponsored by Northrop Grumman
- Horror/Puzzle game made from scratch in Java
- To-Do List application in Python using Tkinter library
- Hearts card game made in C
- Memory allocation and File read/write in C
- Tic-Tac-Toe in C++ with CPU player
- Recursive solution of water jug problem

### Northrop Grumman Launch Vehicle Ground Support Equipment
*Note that screenshots and access to code are limited due to NDA*
- Worked in team of 5 highlighting entire engineering design process.
- Wrote system block diagrams, made technical data package (TDP), Integration status review (ISR), and final acceptance review (FAR) presentations
- Worked with engineers from Northrop Grumman to gather system requirements and gain feedback once-per-week
- Rebuilt from the ground up a Java-based legacy software to a web-based frontend
- Utilized node.js to create a program for NG engineers to run on private servers
- Auto-populated bootstrap tables based on sponsor-provided xml config file
- Cells in tables change dynamically based on sponsor-provided simulated backend
- Frontend gathers incoming data at a rate of 5 Hz, frontend injects new incoming data to corresponding table slot
- Widgets send UDP packet to backend alerting if a value needs to change (switch on/off, button press, etc.)
- Software is used by Northrop Grumman engineers to perform diagnostic checks on launch vehicles before missions

### Water Jug Problem using C++ (2023) [Link](https://github.com/colinherbs13/Waterjug-Problem.git)
- Program that solves the water jug problem using recursion
- User uses command line argument with text file specifying initial state, goal state, and capacity of each of the jugs
- Can either fill a jug completely, empty a jug completely, or pour one jug's liquid into the other jug.
- Checks if current state of jugs meets goal, recursively calls each possible operation, then saves and returns path if valid path is found
